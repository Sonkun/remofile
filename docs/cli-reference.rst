Commands List
=============

This document is the reference of the command-line interface (CLI) of
**Remofile**, which allows one to start a server and perform various file
operations in a sessionless fashion, from a terminal.

Commands are divided into :ref:`client-related commands <client-commands-ref>`
and :ref:`server-related commands <server-commands-ref>`.

.. _client-commands-ref:

Client-related commands
-----------------------
The client-related commands consists of 6 commands, **list**, **file**,
**folder**, **upload**, **download** and **remove**, and they all rely
on a previously configured environment to locate the remote server and
pass the authentication process. Therefore, a set of 4 environment
variables must be set or the command-lines will stop prematurely.

**REMOFILE_HOSTNAME**

The address of the Remote server. Set it to 'localhost' if the server
runs locally.

**REMOFILE_PORT** (optional)

The port to use when connecting to the server. By default, it uses
**6768**.

**REMOFILE_TOKEN**

The token with which the server was configured (a token was generated by the
server if it wasn't explicitly set).

**REMOFILE_PUBLIC_KEY** (optional)

The public key that goes in pair with the private key used on the server
side. By default, a **Remofile** connection is not encrypted.

Example of configuring an environment on Unix-like OSes. ::

    export REMOFILE_HOSTNAME=localhost
    export REMOFILE_PORT=6768
    export REMOFILE_TOKEN=something
    export REMOFILE_PUBLIC_KEY=something

.. click:: remofile.cli:list_files
   :prog: rmf list

.. click:: remofile.cli:create_file
   :prog: rmf file

.. click:: remofile.cli:make_directory
   :prog: rmf folder

.. click:: remofile.cli:upload_files
   :prog: rmf upload

.. click:: remofile.cli:download_files
   :prog: rmf download

.. click:: remofile.cli:remove_files
   :prog: rmf remove

.. _server-commands-ref:

Server-related commands
-----------------------
Unlike the client-related commands, server-related commands don't
require to configure the environment. There are 3 main commands which are
**run**, **start** and **stop**, and they allow you to start and stop a
Remofile with various options. There are also two utility commands which are
**generate-token** and **generate-keys**.

.. click:: remofile.cli:run_server
   :prog: rmf run

.. click:: remofile.cli:start_server
   :prog: rmf start

.. click:: remofile.cli:stop_server
   :prog: rmf stop

.. click:: remofile.cli:generate_token
   :prog: rmf generate-token

.. click:: remofile.cli:generate_keys
   :prog: rmf generate-keys
